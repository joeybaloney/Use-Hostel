Use Hostel is the second novelette I began work on.  I began it because I needed a
higher bandwidth literary outlet when "The Extra" ossified to a state no longer welcoming
to earth-shattering changes.  Certain paragraphs in Chapter I are inspired from Kafka's
"Amerika".  The actual writing began while waiting for the bus from Heathrow to
High Wycombe after my visit to Hoofddorp (3Oct2014).
